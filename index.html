   Hi i am Ekam Singh. 
   I am already doing a job but i have got soome interest in coding like a full stack web developer.
   so i have just started along with the time table i had made 5 days ago and i already learnt:
   1. nodejs
   2. rept.it
   3. conditional
   4. function
   5. for loop
   6. array basics
   5. object

   Now i have added some details for branching like i have done git, github, netfily

   today i have spent some amount of money in borocil company. getting positive vibes on that. let us see i will hold them for more than 5 years.
